        <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, 
        and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do 
        that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.
         This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay 
         begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and
          grasp its main points. </p>
